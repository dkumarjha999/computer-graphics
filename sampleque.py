Write a program to draw sierpensky triangle (recursive and non recursive)

Write a program to draw cubic bazier curve with 'n' control points.

Write a program to draw a cubic B-spine curve with 'n' control points

An '8' is constructed by joining together two cubic Bazier curves. Write a program to draw it.

A triangle PQR has its vertices located at P(80,50), Q(60,10),R(100,10). It is desired to

obtain its reflection about an axis parallel to Y axis and passing through poit A(30,10). Write

program do this transformation

Graphically prove that combination of scaling and rotation is not commutative.

Write a program to continuously rotate an object about a pivot point. Small angles are to be

used for each successive rotation, and approximations to the sine and cosine functions are to

be used to speed up the calculations. The rotation angle for each step is to be chosen so that

the object makes one complete revolution in less than 30 seconds. To avoid accumulation of

coordinate errors, reset the original coordinate values for the object at the start of each new

revolution.

Write a program to draw an analog clock with pendulum. The time should be taken from the

system time.

Write a program to draw a digital clock. Time should be system time the display number size should be at least 1cm x 1cm.
